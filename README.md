# Stock Price Prediction - LSTM vs Transformer

## 1. Introduction

The topic of predicting stock market price has numerous approaches, with a variety of models to choose and implement. In this project, my aim is to evaluate and compare the performance of two neural network architecture in predicting the closing price of a stock: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer.

## 2. Result

2 simple models of LSTM and Transformer are built, and here is their respective mean absolute percentage error, along with the result on test data.
* MAPE of LSTM: 4.457932235544907
* MAPE of Transformer: 3.39259306860331
